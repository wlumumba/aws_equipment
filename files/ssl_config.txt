1) create a self-signed key and certificate pair with OpenSSL in a single command:
	
	sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt

Fill out questions and make sure domain name matches AWS entry for server

2) create a strong Diffie-Hellman group, which is used in negotiating Perfect Forward Secrecy with clients
	
	sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048
	
3) create a new Nginx configuration snippet in the /etc/nginx/snippets directory
	
	sudo vi /etc/nginx/snippets/self-signed.conf
	
	The contents of file are:
	
	ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
	ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
	
4) create another snippet that will define some SSL settings

	sudo vi /etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf
	
	The contents of file are:
	
	# from https://cipherli.st/
	# and https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_nginx.html

	ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
	ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
	ssl_ciphers "EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH";
	ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
	ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
	ssl_session_tickets off;
	ssl_stapling on;
	ssl_stapling_verify on;
	resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 valid=300s;
	resolver_timeout 5s;
	# Disable preloading HSTS for now.  You can use the commented out header line that includes
	# the "preload" directive if you understand the implications.
	#add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains; preload";
	add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains";
	add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
	add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;

	ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;
	
5) Modify nginx site config file

	The following will redirect all http to https port:
	
	server {
		listen 80 default_server;
		listen [::]:80 default_server;
		server_name server_domain_or_IP;
		return 302 https://$server_name$request_uri;
	}
	
	Add the following to the main server directive:
	
	# SSL configuration
    listen 443 ssl http2 default_server;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2 default_server;
    include snippets/self-signed.conf;
    include snippets/ssl-params.conf;
